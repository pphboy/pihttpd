# pihttpd
Inherited TinyHttpd, that is Tiny Http Server Plus


This Program is sample, and not complete.
This Program implemented the normal http server service, like download file, or visit html,js,css,png file.
And You can write c program in directory src/cgi, they are compiled in directory cgi that be a cgi program.
I have some problem, I don't have enough tech-power to analyze http protocol, and resolve http request like normal Server, Nginx or Apache.
It just documented I copy and learn a http server.
